# Project Structure

This project uses [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) for building UI and components on the frontend, along with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/).

Here's the project structure, to help you understand the codebase ⚡️

Using `/app` directory structure from NextJS newer versions. Read about the [latest `/app` directory and structure](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation#create-the-app-folder)

- `/app` has all the pages for the frontend to be served.
- `/components` has all the components (sections / layouts / UI components) to be used by pages and other elements, throughout the project.
- `/lib` has a collection of scripts and useful utilities to be used by modules, throughout the project.
- `/public` has all the static files. Such as media, fonts, RSS-details and etc. Used to serve data in static format.
- `/app/global.css` has all the styles added globally. Used by `/app/layout.tsx` file - to add styles, globally.
